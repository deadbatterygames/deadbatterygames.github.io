<h3>Objective</h3>
The objective of System Fault is to gather Energy and find blueprints for various ship modules, which help you progress through the solar system.

<h3>Equipment</h3>
There are two pieces of equipment available to the player: the Matter Manipulator, and the Multicannon. The Matter Manipulator allows the player to dematerialize ship modules and connect them to the ship, or equip an Energy Pack on the player's back. The Energy Pack allows the player to collect Energy, and also gives the player shields to protect them from damage. The Multicannon is the player's weapon which fires multiple types of projectiles. With the Multicannon equipped, press <b>1|2|3</b> to switch between the types.

<h3>Collecting Energy</h3>
In order to collect Energy, the player must have an Energy Pack equipped on their back. To do so, switch to the Matter Manipulator using <b>TAB</b>, pick up an Energy Pack (the rectangular ship module) using <b>LMB</b>, and click <b>RMB</b> to equip the Energy Pack. Note the health bar that appears at the top - this is the best way to determine whether or not you currently have an Energy Pack equipped. To remove the pack, press <b>RMB</b> again with the Matter Manipulator equipped. Make sure you aren't holding another object, or this will not work. Once an Energy Pack is equipped on the player's back, use the Multicannon to shoot Energy crystals, and walk over the shards to collect them.

<h3>Blueprints</h3>
Find Blueprint Ports (orange terminals) to unlock a specific blueprint that the player can use at Part Printers. If the player hasn't collected any blueprints, the Bronze Energy Pack blueprint will be available to print for free. Otherwise, each module requires a certain amount of Energy to print, based on its type and tier.

<h3>Part Printers</h3>
Use Part Printer Ports (blue terminals) on the landing pads to print modules from the blueprints you have collected. Press <b>A|D</b> to change the module type, <b>W|S</b> to change the module tier, and <b>SPACE</b> to print the module. In order to print a part, the player must have an Energy Pack equipped with enough Energy, and the print surface must be relatively clear.

<h3>Modular Space Ship</h3>
Each ship module has a separate functionality:

<ul>
<li><b>Energy Packs</b> power the ship and its shields</li>
<li><b>Thrusters</b> allow you to fly the ship forward and back</li>
<li><b>Boosters</b> allow you to turn and strafe the ship</li>
<li><b>Quantum Drives</b> allow you to jump to other planets</li>
</ul>

There are also two types of weapon modules available:
<ul>
<li><b>Laser Cannons</b> are accurate and have unlimited ammo, but do less damage</li>
<li><b>Missile Racks</b> will lock onto targets (eventually - this feature hasn't been implemented yet) and do much more damage, but have limited ammo (based on their tier)</li>
</ul>

When you pick up a module with the Matter Manipulator, a holographic module of the same type will appear on your ship, indicating where it goes. Move the module close enough so that the slot turns green, then click <b>LMB</b> to connect the module to your ship. Each module has 3 tiers which are indicated by its colour - bronze, silver or gold. The tiers will affect the quality and performance of the module - for example Gold Energy Packs hold more Energy and have more shields, Gold Thrusters allow you to go faster, Gold Boosters will give you better handling, and so on.  <br><br>

<b>Note:</b> You cannot enter your ship while wearing an Energy Pack. Click <b>RMB</b> with the Matter Manipulator equipped to remove your Energy Pack and <b>LMB</b> to attach it to your ship's appropriate slot.

<h3>Space Ship Assist Modes</h3>
The space ship has 3 assist modes available: Hover Mode (H), which allows you to make fine adjustments to the ship at low speeds, Astro Flight (A) which allows you to adjust a throttle which keeps your ship at a consistent speed, and Quantum Jump (Q) which allows you to travel quickly to other planets. Press <b>LEFT SHIFT</b> to toggle between Hover Mode and Astro Flight, and press <b>LEFT CTRL</b> to toggle the assists on and off. When the assists are off, the ship will move much faster, but it will maintain its heading velocity, and be much harder to maneuver. Press <b>Z</b> while looking at a planet to set a target for Quantum Jump. A planet may be targeted in free look (press <b>RMB</b> to toggle), in which case a reticle will appear indicating the direction the ship needs to turn before the jump is initiated.
