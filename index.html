<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
This project is currently under development. There are many features which have not yet been implemented, and many bugs which need squashing.

<h3>Objective</h3>
The objective of System Fault is to gather Energy and find blueprints for various ship modules, which help you progress through the solar system.

<h3>Equipment</h3>
There are two pieces of equipment available to the player: the Matter Manipulator, and the Multicannon. The Matter Manipulator allows the player to dematerialize ship modules and connect them to the ship, or equip an Energy Pack on the player's back. The Energy Pack allows the player to collect Energy, and also gives the player shields to protect them from damage. The Multicannon is the player's weapon which fires multiple types of projectiles. Press <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to switch between weapon types, once you have unlocked them.

<h3>Collecting Energy</h3>
Energy is used for charging the player's shields, and printing print modules. In order to collect Energy, the player must have an Energy Pack equipped on their back. To do so, switch to the Matter Manipulator using <b>TAB</b>, pick up an Energy Pack (the rectangular ship module) using <b>LMB</b>, and click <b>RMB</b> to equip the Energy Pack. Note the health bar that appears at the top - this is the best way to determine whether or not you currently have an Energy Pack equipped. To remove the pack, press <b>RMB</b> again with the Matter Manipulator equipped. Make sure you aren't holding another object, or this will not work. Once an Energy Pack is equipped on the player's back, use the Multicannon to shoot Energy crystals, and walk over the shards to collect them.

<h3>Player Shield</h3>
The Energy Pack can also shield the player from damage, in and outside the ship. Since the Energy Pack also provides power to the ship and you can't take off without one, the shield will always be available when flying. While exploring on foot, the player must remove the Energy Pack from the ship, then equip it on the player's back, otherwise the shield will not be available! The shield cells must also be charged by holding <b>C</b>, which consumes Energy in the pack. This works in and out of the ship, as long as the Energy Pack is equipped.

<h3>Blueprints</h3>
Find Blueprint Ports (orange terminals) to unlock a specific blueprint that the player can use at Part Printers. If the player hasn't collected any blueprints, the Bronze Energy Pack blueprint will be available to print for free. Otherwise, each module requires a certain amount of Energy to print, based on its type and tier.

<h3>Part Printers</h3>
Use Part Printer Ports (blue terminals) on the landing pads to print modules from the blueprints you have collected. Press <b>A</b> and <b>D</b> to change the module type, <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> to change the module tier, and <b>SPACE</b> to print the module. In order to print a part, the player must have an Energy Pack equipped with enough Energy, and the print surface must be relatively clear.

<h3>Modular Space Ship</h3>
Each ship module has a separate functionality. It is recommended to print and install the following 4 parts before flying, however a Quantum Drive is optional, and you can still fly to other planets without one. Thrusters and Boosters can be used independently, but it is not recommended.

<ul>
<li><b>Energy Packs</b> store Energy and provides power to the ship and the player's shields</li>
<li><b>Thrusters</b> allow you to fly the ship forward and back</li>
<li><b>Boosters</b> allow you to turn and strafe the ship</li>
<li><b>Quantum Drives</b> allow you to jump to other planets quickly</li>
</ul>

There are also two types of weapon modules available:
<ul>
<li><b>Laser Cannons</b> are accurate and have unlimited ammo, but do less damage</li>
<li><b>Missile Racks</b> lock onto targets and do much more damage, but have limited ammo (based on their tier)</li>
</ul>

When you pick up a module with the Matter Manipulator, a holographic module of the same type will appear on your ship, indicating where it goes. Move the module close enough so that the slot turns green, then click <b>LMB</b> to connect the module to your ship. Each module has 3 tiers which are indicated by its colour - bronze, silver or gold. The tiers will affect the quality and performance of the module - for example Gold Energy Packs hold more Energy and have more shields, Gold Thrusters allow you to go faster, Gold Boosters will give you better handling, and so on.  <br><br>

<b>Note:</b> You cannot enter your ship while wearing an Energy Pack. Click <b>RMB</b> with the Matter Manipulator equipped to remove your Energy Pack and <b>LMB</b> to attach it to your ship's appropriate slot.

<h3>Space Ship Assist Modes</h3>
The space ship has 3 assist modes available: Hover Mode (<b>H</b>), which allows you to make fine adjustments to the ship at low speeds, Astro Flight (<b>A</b>) which allows you to adjust a throttle which keeps your ship at a consistent speed, and Quantum Jump (<b>Q</b>) which allows you to travel quickly to other planets. Press <b>LEFT SHIFT</b> to toggle between Hover Mode and Astro Flight, and press <b>LEFT CTRL</b> to toggle the assists on and off. When the assists are off, the ship will have a higher top speed, but it will be influenced by gravity, and will maintain its heading velocity, making it much more difficult to maneuver. This is useful for zero g, or getting the ship into orbit. Press <b>Z</b> while looking at a planet to set a target for Quantum Jump. A planet may be targeted in free look (press <b>RMB</b> to toggle), in which case a reticle will appear indicating the direction the ship needs to turn before the jump is initiated.
