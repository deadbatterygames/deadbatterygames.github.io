<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
This project is currently under development, and was not optimized for use in WebGL. You may experience poor performance and collision issues on the web version, specifically <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-rigidbody-not-colliding-with-specific-mesh-colliders" target="_blank">this one</a>. For best results, download the Windows desktop version. If you would like a version of the project to run on macOS, please contact me <a href="mailto:eric.r.thompson@icloud.com">here</a>. All scripts, assets and music were created by me. Only the Post Processing Stack Unity package was used.

<h3>Objective</h3>
The objective of System Fault is to gather Energy and find blueprints for various ship modules, which help you progress through the solar system. Currently, the game spawns you in a test scene with all the blueprints and modules immediately available to the player.

<h3>Equipment</h3>
There are two pieces of equipment available to the player: the Matter Manipulator, and the Multicannon. The Matter Manipulator allows the player to dematerialize ship modules and connect them to the ship, or equip a Fuel Pack on the player's back. The Fuel Pack allows the player to collect Energy, and also gives the player shields to protect them from damage. The Multicannon is the weapon available to the player, which will eventually have multiple types the player can switch between, allowing for a rock-paper-scissors combat system.

<h3>Collecting Energy</h3>
In order to collect Energy, the player must have a Fuel Pack equipped on their back. To do so, switch to the Matter Manipulator using <b>TAB</b>, pick up a Fuel Pack (the rectangular ship module) using <b>LMB</b>, and click <b>RMB</b> to equip the Fuel Pack. Note the health bar that appears at the top - this is the best way to determine whether or not you currently have a Fuel Pack equipped. To remove the pack, press <b>RMB</b> with the Matter Manipulator equipped. Make sure you aren't holding another object, or this will not work. Once a Fuel Pack is equipped on the player's back, use the Multicannon to shoot Energy crystals, and walk over the shards to collect them.

<h3>Blueprints</h3>
Each of the orange terminals will unlock a specific blueprint that the player can use at Part Printers. Eventually these terminals will be rewarded to the player at the end of Refineries, which are underground dungeons built by the enemy robots. If the player hasn't collected any blueprints, the Tier 1 Fuel Pack blueprint will be available for free.

<h3>Part Printers</h3>
The blue terminals on the landing pads allow the player to print parts from a list of blueprints they have collected. Press <b>E</b> to interact with the terminal, <b>A|D</b> to change the module, <b>W|S</b> to change the module's tier, and <b>SPACE</b> to print the module. In order to print a part, the player must have a Fuel Pack (the rectangular ship module) equipped with enough Energy, and the print surface must be relatively clear. Press <b>E</b> again to exit the terminal.</p>

<h3>Modular Space Ship</h3>
Each module of the ship has a separate functionality: Fuel Packs power the ship and its shields, Boosters allow you to turn and strafe, Thrusters allow you to fly forward and back, and Quantum Drives allow you to jump to other planets. Each module has 3 tiers which are indicated by the bronze/silver/gold colour of the module. When you pick up a module with the Matter Manipulator, holographic slots will be shown on your ship. Match the shape of the module to the correct slot, and click <b>LMB</b> when the slot is green to connect the module to your ship. To power on your ship, make sure at least a Fuel Pack and Boosters (the module that goes into the wings) are connected to your ship, that the Fuel Pack has Energy, and then press <b>SPACE</b>.<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> You cannot enter your ship while wearing a Fuel Pack. Click <b>RMB</b> with the Matter Manipulator equipped to remove your Fuel Pack and <b>LMB</b> to attach it to your ship's appropriate slot.

<h3>Space Ship Assist Modes</h3>
The space ship has 3 assist modes available: Hover Mode (H), which allows you to make fine adjustments to the ship at a low speed, Astro Flight (A) which allows you to adjust a throttle controlling your ship's constant speed, and Quantum Jump (Q) which allows you to jump to other planets. Press <b>LEFT SHIFT</b> to toggle between Hover Mode and Astro Flight, and press <b>LEFT CTRL</b> to toggle the assists on and off. When the assists are off, the ship will move much faster, but it will maintain its heading velocity, and be much harder to maneuver. Press <b>Z</b> while looking at a planet to set a target for Quantum Jump. A planet may be targeted in free look (press <b>RMB</b> to toggle), in which case a reticle will appear indicating the direction the ship needs to turn before the jump is initiated.
